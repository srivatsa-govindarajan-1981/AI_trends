    // TALK TRACK CONTENT (embedded)
    const RAW = String.raw`Slide 1: Title Slide (2 Mins)
• Concept: Framing AI as a leadership opportunity for Shanti Bhavan students.
• Speaker Bullets:
• Welcome the students. Emphasize that this is about "Agentic AI"—not just chatting with a bot.
• Set the year: 2026. This is the current state of the art.
• Talk Track: "Welcome. We aren't here to talk about a trend; we are here to talk about a shift in the 'physics' of work. You are the future architects of the Orchestration Era."
Slide 2: Agenda (3 Mins)
• Concept: The journey from LLM "brains" to Agentic "workers".
• Speaker Bullets:
• Walk through the 6 chapters: LLMs, Prompting, Agents, Patterns, Impact, and Personal Strategy.
• Goal: Leave with a playbook you can apply today.
• Talk Track: "We have a lot to cover. We start with how these models think, then how to control them, and finally, how you can use them to bootstrap your careers."
Slide 3: History of Language AI (4 Mins)
• Concept: Contextualizing current tech as a 20-year evolution.
• Speaker Bullets:
• Explain that Language AI existed long before ChatGPT.
• Highlight 2017 (Attention) as the most important date on the timeline.
• Talk Track: "It's easy to think this happened overnight. It didn't. It's 20 years of small math breakthroughs that finally exploded in 2022."
Slide 4: How can a computer understand Human language? (5 Mins)
• Concept: The bridge between human words and computer numbers.
• Speaker Bullets:
• Explain that computers don't see words; they see numerical values.
• Transition from counting words to "mapping" their relationships.
• Talk Track: "To a computer, the word 'Apple' is just a coordinate in a vast mathematical map. Let's see how that map started."
Slide 5: Bag-of-words (4 Mins)
• Concept: The first (and flawed) attempt to process language.
• Speaker Bullets:
• The computer simply counts word frequency.
• The Flaw: It loses meaning. "Man bites dog" and "Dog bites man" look identical to this model.
• Talk Track: "We used to just count words. It was like trying to understand a recipe by only knowing how many cups of flour it used, without knowing when to add the eggs."
Slide 6: Word Embeddings (Vector Space) (5 Mins)
• Concept: Turning meaning into 3D geography.
• Speaker Bullets:
• Words with similar meanings live near each other.
• Mention "King - Man + Woman = Queen" as proof that math can represent meaning.
• Talk Track: "This is where AI gets smart. It learned that words are defined by the 'company they keep'—if 'happy' and 'joyful' are used in the same context, they become mathematical neighbors."
Slide 7: LLMs Basics (Tokenization & Transformers) (6 Mins)
• Concept: The mechanics of "Next-Token Prediction".
• Speaker Bullets:
• Tokens: Models see fragments of words, not whole words.
• Transformer: The "Attention" mechanism lets the model look at the entire sentence at once.
• Talk Track: "An LLM is a world-class guesser. It predicts the next token based on everything it has seen before, using the Transformer to focus on the most important words in your request."

Transition Question (Understanding Check): "If I ask an AI 'The capital of India is...', is it looking that fact up in a book, or is it calculating the most likely next word?"
Slide 8: Prompt Engineering (5 Mins)
• Concept: Precision instruction through structure.
• Speaker Bullets:
• The Template: Persona, Task, Context, Format, Audience, Tone, Data.
• Why it works: Clear constraints guide the model to better results.
• Talk Track: "Prompting is a new type of engineering. To get a professional result, you must give the model a job description, not just a question."
Slide 9: Good and bad prompts (5 Mins)
• Concept: Practical examples of specificity.
• Speaker Bullets:
• Contrast the generic "climate" prompt with the "Shanti Bhavan/India" prompt.
• Highlight the use of local data (NITI Aayog/IMD) to ground the answer.
• Talk Track: "A bad prompt is a lucky dip. A good prompt is a direct order. Notice how adding specific Indian data sources makes the AI actually useful for your community."
Slide 10: Approach to using LLMs "Vibing" (Iteration) (5 Mins)
• Concept: The human-in-the-loop conversation.
• Speaker Bullets:
• "Vibing" is the iterative loop: Prompt → Review → Feedback → Repeat.
• Your role: You own the vision; the LLM provides the labor.
• Talk Track: "Treat the LLM like an eager, bright intern. You must review every line it writes and give it specific feedback to make it better."
Slide 11: LLMs - The Bad, and the Ugly (5 Mins)
• Concept: Critical awareness of AI failures.
• Speaker Bullets:
• Hallucinations: Confident falsehoods.
• Brittle Reasoning: It can sound smart but fail simple logic if reworded.
• Security: Mention prompt injection and jailbreaks.
• Talk Track: "AI is powerful but dangerous. It can lie to you with perfect grammar. Never delegate your critical thinking to a machine."
Transition Question (Understanding Check): "If an AI gives you a perfect code snippet that solves your problem, should you ship it immediately? Why not?"
Slide 12: Agentic AI (5 Mins)
• Concept: Transitioning from "Chat" to "Goals".
• Speaker Bullets:
• Analogy: LLM = Calculator; Agent = Accountant.
• Agents work toward a goal until the job is done.
• Talk Track: "A chatbot answers you. An agent finishes the task for you. This is the difference between a tool and a worker."
Slide 13: Three pillars of agency (5 Mins)
• Concept: The three modular parts of an agent.
• Speaker Bullets:
• Planning: Breaking tasks into sub-goals.
• Memory: Short-term (context) vs Long-term (RAG).
• Tool Use: Calling APIs and apps.
• Talk Track: "An agent needs three things to be useful: a plan, a memory, and hands (tools) to interact with the world."
Slide 14: The agentic loop (4 Mins)
• Concept: The cycle of self-reflection.
• Speaker Bullets:
• Goal → Plan → Act → Observe → Refine → Repeat.
• Observe: The agent checks its own work and fixes mistakes.
• Talk Track: "An agent doesn't just stop. It observes the result of its action, and if it's wrong, it reflects and tries again."
Slide 15: How Agentic AI builds solutions (Multi-agent) (5 Mins)
• Concept: Specialist agents collaborating.
• Speaker Bullets:
• Multi-agent patterns: One specialist drafts, one reviewer verifies.
• Benefits: Higher accuracy and fewer hallucinations through cross-checking.
• Talk Track: "Think of this as a team. You can have one agent who is a great coder and another who is a strict security auditor. Together, they build something better than a single model ever could."
Slide 16: Impact of Generative AI (Software & Education) (5 Mins)
• Concept: The shift in professional value.
• Speaker Bullets:
• AI is writing up to 30% of enterprise code now.
• Risk: Entry-level roles are shrinking for those who only know syntax.
• Talk Track: "The 'syntax expert' is being replaced. The market now rewards those who can architect systems using AI assistants."
Slide 17: The Future of Tech Work (Orchestration Era) (5 Mins)
• Concept: The 99% vs 1% framework.
• Speaker Bullets:
• 99% Automated: Execution, summarizing, and basic code.
• 1% Human: Strategy, Judgment, and Problem Decomposition.
• Talk Track: "If the AI does the 99% of 'doing' for free, the value of the 1%—the 'deciding'—explodes. You must own that 1%."
Slide 18: The Orchestration Era (Where the Value Lives) (5 Mins)
• Concept: The Forward-Deployed Engineer.
• Speaker Bullets:
• Don't sit in an "ivory tower." Sit inside the business process.
• Build the "connective tissue" between messy data and AI.
• Talk Track: "If the cost of 'doing' goes to zero, what is the value of 'deciding'? Your career is built on the judgment that AI can't replicate."
Slide 19: Your 2026 Career Playbook (6 Mins)
• Concept: Concrete steps for career bootstrapping.
• Speaker Bullets:
• Step 1: Strategic Decomposition.
• Step 2: Domain Stacking (Finance/NGO Management).
• Step 3: Operational Intelligence.
• Step 4: Agentic Portfolio (document failures!).
• Talk Track: "This is your map. Don't just show a perfect app. Show a portfolio that proves you know how to fix AI when it breaks."
Slide 20: Thanks / Discussion (45 Mins)
• Concept: Q&A and deep reflection.
• Speaker Bullets:
• Open for questions. Use the Appendix slides (21-23) to show real tools.
• Talk Track: "We’ve seen the map. Now, tell me where you want to go. What are your questions?"`;
